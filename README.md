# Data Structure Algorithm Visualizer
## Purpose of the project
1. The project is to visualize the different types of data structures algorithm based on
their classification i.e., linear data structure or non-linear data structures. Within the
linear data structures, visualization of arrays and linked lists with their
implementation of stack and queues is done. Within non-linear data structure,
visualization of trees and graphs is done. Also, apart from this visualization of several
sorting and searching along with Prim, Kruskal, Knapsack etc. algorithms will also be
implemented. 
2. Apart from this, the time and space complexity would also be displayed
against the visualization which would therefore make it easier to understand.
â€¢ This project would in turn help the students to be comfortable and easily grasp the
DSA concepts including time and space complexity of the algorithms.

## Project Features
1. When studying difficult subject topics like algorithms, it is crucial for students to have a solid understanding of the subject because it will
serve as the basis for their computational thinking and programming abilities. We had seen that using traditional teaching techniques made it a 
little more challenging for both teachers and students to articulate their ideas. Additionally, we are well known that we tend to learn more about 
a given issue the more we actively participate and do things for ourselves. 

2. During classes on data structures and algorithms, this tool can be a useful addition to the standard classroom instruction and textbook. 
In this paper, a software tool that allows for the display of frequently used data structures and the insertion and deletion actions connected to them is presented. 
Additionally, user-defined algorithms can be animated using this software.

3. Algorithm Visualization tool can be seen as the most popular tool in the field of computer science. It can be used by students to grasp the concept of data structures and supporting algorithms easily. 
Even while teaching it can be used in an efficient manner. Users will be able to visually understand and analyze the working of various algorithms.

## Software Quality Attributes
1. Portability: Our project is a software (java code) which can be easily portable from one device to another. Since we have used Git for version control and Github for project sharing, our project is highly portable.
 
2. Usability: Usability is the degree of ease with which products or software can be used to achieve required goals effectively and efficiently. Our project provides a simple and friendly user interface keeping ease-of-use for users in our mind. 
 
3. Testability: The project can be easily broken down into sub-components based on the algorithms. Each data structure's algorithm can be individually tested and visualized.
